        <p>Today I started learning HTML and CSS. I guess it is very interesting and fascinating to learn them on Khan Academy platform. I have passed 2 lessons.</p>

        <p> Learning is continuing. Today I have passed the third lesson and now I know more information about CSS. Keep doing!</p>

        <p>I hope I will finish my lessons soon, because it takes a lot time for me to finish all projects of the platform.</p>
